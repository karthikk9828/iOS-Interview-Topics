## iOS `UIViewController` Lifecycle Methods

1. **Initialization**:
   - `init(nibName:bundle:)` or `init(coder:)`: The initializer methods for creating the view controller, either from a nib file or from a coder (in case of storyboard).

2. **Loading Views**:
   - `loadView()`: If the view controller's view is not set programmatically or loaded from a storyboard/nib, you can override this method to create the view hierarchy manually.

3. **View Lifecycle**:
   - `viewDidLoad()`: Called after the view hierarchy is loaded into memory. It's typically used for initial setup, such as configuring UI elements and initializing data. However, the frame of the view is not yet finalized at this point.
   - `viewWillAppear(_:)`: Called just before the view is about to be added to the view hierarchy and become visible. This method is called every time the view is about to appear on the screen.
   - `viewDidAppear(_:)`: Called after the view has been added to the view hierarchy and becomes visible on the screen.
   - `viewWillDisappear(_:)`: Called just before the view is removed from the view hierarchy and disappears from the screen.
   - `viewDidDisappear(_:)`: Called after the view has been removed from the view hierarchy and is no longer visible on the screen.

4. **Layout and Rotation**:
   - `viewWillLayoutSubviews()`: Called just before the view controller's view lays out its subviews.
   - `viewDidLayoutSubviews()`: Called after the view controller's view lays out its subviews. This is where you should perform additional layout adjustments if needed.
   - `willRotate(to:duration:)`: Called just before the view controller's view is about to rotate to a new orientation.
   - `didRotate(from: )`: Called after the view controller's view has rotated to a new orientation.

5. **Memory Warnings**:
   - `didReceiveMemoryWarning()`: Called when the system issues a memory warning. You can implement this method to free up any resources that can be recreated.

6. **Unloading Views**:
   - `viewWillUnload()` (Deprecated): Called just before the view controller's view is about to be unloaded from memory. Deprecated in iOS 6.
   - `viewDidUnload()` (Deprecated): Called after the view controller's view has been unloaded from memory. Deprecated in iOS 6.

7. **Deinitialization**:
   - `deinit`: The deinitializer method, called when the view controller is deallocated from memory.

## Here's a visual representation of the typical lifecycle order:

init(nibName:bundle:)
loadView()
viewDidLoad()
viewWillAppear(_:)
viewWillLayoutSubviews()
viewDidLayoutSubviews()
viewDidAppear(_:)
viewWillDisappear(_:)
viewDidDisappear(_:)
didReceiveMemoryWarning()
deinit
