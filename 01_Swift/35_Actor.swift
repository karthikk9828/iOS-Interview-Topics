/**
    Swift actors are a new concurrency feature introduced in Swift 5.5 (iOS 15) and later
    that provide a safe and efficient way to manage shared mutable state. 
    Actors are a type of object that can be accessed concurrently from multiple threads, 
    but ensure that access to their mutable state is serialized and thread-safe. 

    Note:
        * Actors do not support inheritence.
        * Properties and methods of actor can be accessed using `await` keyword.
