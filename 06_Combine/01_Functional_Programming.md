# Key concepts in Functional Programming 
- Observable
- Observer
- Operators

## Observable
- An entity that produces data events
- ex: user input, sensor data, API response

## Observer
- An entity that listens to the the events emitted by observables
- there are things in combine framework that are both Observable and Observer
- ex: Application components, views

## Operators
- Functions to transform and manipulate data
- ex: map, filter, merge
